- Jack: Cashapp IS culture
- 3 new Bitcoin products: 

1) paid in bitcoin
2) bitcoin roundups -> round up amounts, save in btc)
3) Lightning receives -> receive btc over lightning network. Scale with userbase is huge

Innovation: 
- Combine on chain QR code and lightning invoice into a single QR code. Bip 21 -> old but not widely used. Single QR = ++UX improvement
